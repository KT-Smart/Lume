# Lint/format tools use a separate build dir so they never contend with Lefthook's
# SPM lock while a hook runs. SwiftLint is a prebuilt binary; SwiftFormat builds from
# source once (~20s) and is cached — warm it now so the first commit isn't slow.
# Worktrees run these same binaries (Scripts/lint-tool.sh).
